# bash/zsh completion support for core Git.

# Copyright (C) 2006,2007 Shawn O. Pearce <spearce@spearce.org>
# Conceptually based on gitcompletion (http://gitweb.hawaga.org.uk/).
# Distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.0.
#
# The contained completion routines provide support for completing:
#
#    *) local and remote branch names
#    *) local and remote tag names
#    *) .git/remotes file names
#    *) git 'subcommands'
#    *) git email aliases for git-send-email
#    *) tree paths within 'ref:path/to/file' expressions
#    *) file paths within current working directory and index
#    *) common --long-options
#
# To use these routines:
#
#    1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-completion.bash).
#    2) Add the following line to your .bashrc/.zshrc:
#        source ~/.git-completion.bash
#    3) Consider changing your PS1 to also show the current branch,
#       see git-prompt.sh for details.
#
# If you use complex aliases of form '!f() { ... }; f', you can use the null
# command ':' as the first command in the function body to declare the desired
# completion style.  For example '!f() { : git commit ; ... }; f' will
# tell the completion to use commit completion.  This also works with aliases
# of form "!sh -c '...'".  For example, "!sh -c ': git commit ; ... '".

# This function can be used to access a tokenized list of words
# on the command line:
#
#	__git_reassemble_comp_words_by_ref '=:'
#	if test "${words_[cword_-1]}" = -w
#	then
#		...
#	fi
#
# The argument should be a collection of characters from the list of
# word completion separators (COMP_WORDBREAKS) to treat as ordinary
# characters.
#
# This is roughly equivalent to going back in time and setting
# COMP_WORDBREAKS to exclude those characters.  The intent is to
# make option types like --date=<type> and <rev>:<path> easy to
# recognize by treating each shell word as a single token.
#
# It is best not to set COMP_WORDBREAKS directly because the value is
# shared with other completion scripts.  By the time the completion
# function gets called, COMP_WORDS has already been populated so local
# changes to COMP_WORDBREAKS have no effect.
#
# Output: words_, cword_, cur_.
